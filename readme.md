# Grad School Acceptance Prediction

This project aims to predict and study the acceptance/rejection of applicants to a grad school program using machine learning techniques. Two techniques are attempted: a random forest classifier and a neural network to predict whether an applicant will recieve either an acceptanced or a rejected status based on various metrics provided by the applicants.

## Dataset

I retrieved the data from the unofficial subreddit of UT Austin's Master of Science in Data Science program. Luckily, there are several threads for each admission period, ranging from Fall/Spring 2021 up to Fall/Spring 2023, and all with identical formattingâ€”making data preparation and preprocessing relatively straightforward. Below is a picture example of the data layout:

The dataset used in this project is formatted as JSON and contains the following fields for each applicant:

- `status`: The acceptance/rejection status of the applicant.
- `applicationDate`: The date of application.
- `decisionDate`: The date of the admission decision.
- `education`: Information about the applicant's educational background, including institution, degree, and GPA.
- `gre`: In comma separated format, listing highest Quant, Verbal and Writing Scores among submitted, NaN if not submitted. 
- `recommendations`: The number of recommendations received.
- `experience`: Details about the applicant's relevant work experience.
- `statementOfPurpose`: A binary indicator (Y/N) for the presence of a statement of purpose and perhaps alongside an assisting comment.
- `comments`: Additional, miscellaneous comments provided by the applicant.

## Project Structure

The project directory has the following structure:

- `data/`: Contains the JSON dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- Other necessary project files.
